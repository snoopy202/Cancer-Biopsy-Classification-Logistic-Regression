Breast cancer tumors are very complicated at the cellular level, and this makes determining whether a patient's tumor is malignant (dangerous) or benign (not dangerous) a challenge. Your task will be to build a classifier that can determine whether a sample is malignant or benign to help your colleague!\n",
